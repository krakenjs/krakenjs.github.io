## Getting started



#### 1. Install the generator

Start by installing the generator globally using npm: `sudo npm install -g generator-kraken`



#### 2. Create a project

Once installed, you can create a basic project using the generator. Type `yo kraken` and follow the prompts:


{% highlight text %}
$ yo kraken

     ,'""`.
    / _  _ \
    |(@)(@)|   Release the Kraken!
    )  __  (
   /,'))((`.\
  (( ((  )) ))
   `\ `)(' /'

[?] Application name: HelloWorld
[?] Description: A test kraken application
[?] Author: YourName GoesHere
...
{% endhighlight %}


The generator will create a new directory for your application, set up an empty project and download all the necessary dependencies.



#### 3. Start your server

To run your project, just go into the newly created directory and type `npm start`:


{% highlight text %}
$ cd HelloWorld
$ npm start

> helloworld@0.0.1 start ~/HelloWorld
> node index.js

Listening on 8000
{% endhighlight %}


Your kraken application will start up on port 8000. You can visit it at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). If all goes well, your very polite application will say hello.



### Structure of a Project

Kraken keeps your code organized by splitting up the configuration, content+templates and routing logic into different places so that it's easy to keep track of everything and to easily swap out components. Let's start by looking at the base structure of the project you just created:


{% highlight text %}
/config  
Application and middleware configuration

/controllers
Routes and logic

/locales
Language specific content bundles

/models
Models

/public
Web resources that are publicly available

/public/templates
Server and browser-side templates

/tests
Unit and functional test cases

index.js
Application entry point 
{% endhighlight %}


Let's say you want to create a simple application. As your application grows, this becomes unmanageable and messy. Kraken helps you stay organized by imposing a sound structure and strategy.

First let's look at our basic `index.js` entry point:


{% highlight javascript %}
'use strict';
 
var kraken = require('kraken-js'),
    app = {};
 
// Fired when an app configures itself
app.configure = function (nconf, next) {
    next();
};
 
// Fired at the beginning of an incoming request
app.requestStart = function (server) { };
 
// Fired before routing occurs
app.requestBeforeRoute = function (server) { };
 
// Fired after routing occurs
app.requestAfterRoute = function requestAfterRoute(server) { };
 
kraken.create(app).listen(function (err) {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err.stack);
    }
});
{% endhighlight %}


As you can see, the entry point simply provides hooks for configuration, and request-specific functionality that is called at the start of the request, as well as before and after the routing takes place.

So, where's all the configuration? Where are the routes?



### Configuration

Kraken's configuration can be found in the `config/app.json` file.

This JSON file contains key value pairs that are loaded at runtime. The advantage of this is that all your application configuration is in a single, well-known place; and you can swap it out without having to touch a single line of code.



#### Development vs. Production environments

A common scenario is that development environments have slightly different parameters than production. Kraken allows you to define a second file `config/app-development.json` with alternate values.

You can control which file is loaded by defining an environment variable: `NODE_ENV` and setting its value to `production` or `development` as appropriate.



### Security

Security is provided out-of-the-box by the [Lusca](http://github.com/krakenjs/lusca) module. Lusca is middleware for express, and it follows [OWASP](http://www.owasp.org/) best practices by enabling the following request/response headers for all calls:

- [Cross Site Request Forgery](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29)
- [Content Security Policy](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Content_Security_Policy)
- [Platform for Privacy Preferences Project](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290333)
- [X-FRAME-OPTIONS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking)
- And more!


If you want to disable or configure them, please see the [Lusca README](http://github.com/krakenjs/lusca).



### Routes

Kraken moves the routing logic into separate files in the `controllers` folder, allowing you to group routes by functionality.

For example, a route for your home page, would use a `controllers/index.js` file that looks as follows:


{% highlight javascript %}
'use strict';

var IndexModel = require('../models/index');

module.exports = function (server) {
    var model = new IndexModel();
 
    server.get('/', function (req, res) {
        res.render('index', model);
    });
};
{% endhighlight %}


This file would define the routes and the logic for the home page. The advantage of keeping routes and logic segregated in individual files starts to show as the application grows. If something fails, it's very easy to pinpoint where things went wrong.

Kraken is built on top of express, so the rest of the logic should be familiar to Node developers



### Models

Kraken also separates data models from the controller logic, resulting in cleaner, more organized code. Data models live in the `models` folder.

When a new controller is created, the framework will also create a simple model for you.


{% highlight javascript %}
'use strict';

module.exports = function IndexModel() {
    return {
        name: 'myApp'
    };
};
{% endhighlight %}


While not very complex, this model serves as a base to build upon. See the [Kraken Shopping Cart](https://github.com/lmarkus/Kraken_Example_Shopping_Cart) example for more complex usage of models.


### Templates

Kraken uses [LinkedIn's Dust](http://linkedin.github.io/dustjs/) as the templating language of choice. [Adaro](http://github.com/krakenjs/adaro) is the module responsible for rendering and managing the templates.

Templates are loaded from the `public/templates` directory. Because they reside in the public folder, this allows kraken to use the same templates on the server side as well as the client side, allowing you to reuse code.

If we wanted to greet our customers, a basic template would be:


{% highlight html %}
<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
{% endhighlight %}


### Localization

Thanks to [Makara](http://github.com/krakenjs/makara), kraken has the ability to load content bundles on the fly, based on the request context. If we wanted to greet a user in their native language (e.g.: Spanish), we can simply add this context to the response before rendering the template:


{% highlight javascript %}
res.locals.context = { 
  locality: {
    language: 'es',
    country: 'ES'
  } 
};
var model = { name: 'Antonio Banderas' };
res.render('index',model);
{% endhighlight %}


We would also change our template as follows, using a `@pre type="content"` tag:


{% highlight html %}
<h1>{@pre type="content" key="index.greeting"/}</h1>
{% endhighlight %}

This instructs the framework to pick up the index.greeting string from one of the locale content bundles.

The `locales` directory holds these bundles, organized by country and language. The bundles are nothing more than simple `key=value` .property files. If our sample application caters to English and Spanish speakers, we would create two bundles:

`locales/US/en/index.properties` to hold `index.greeting=Hello {name}!`

and

`locales/ES/es/index.properties` to hold `index.greeting=Hola {name}!`

So, in the above example, since the locality is set to `es_ES`, the framework would pick the second bundle, and display:


{% highlight text %}
Hola Antonio Banderas!
{% endhighlight %}
